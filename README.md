# TRAVELOPS-BOT :

This project focuses on a website that was created to serve as the finest destination for users.

# Azure services used in this project

1)AI power virtual agent 2)Static webapps 3)Azure Bot Service

I utilised an AI-powered virtual agent to create a question and answer set. I combined an AI-powered virtual agent with a web app bot. Then, I utilised Static Web App Service for hosting. A service called Azure Static Web Apps uses a code repository to automatically generate and launch full stack web apps on Azure.

# Azure Static Web Apps: 

The following are some of the primary attributes of Azure Static Web Apps that led me to select this offering:

1.Web hosting for pictures, JavaScript, CSS, and other static material.

2.Azure Functions offers integrated API support with the possibility to connect an already-existing Azure Functions app with a normal account.

3.Outstanding GitHub and Azure DevOps integration, in which builds and deploys are triggered by changes to the repository.

4.Static material that is delivered globally, bringing it closer to your users.

5.Free SSL certificates that renew themselves automatically.

6.Unique domains to provide your app branded modifications.
